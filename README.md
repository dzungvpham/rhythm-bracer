Simply turn RECORD switch ON to indicate that you want to record a pattern.
TAP your pattern. What you hear is what you get (WYHIWYG).
Turn the RECORD switch OFF once done. If green light is shown, pattern is saved. Else if yellow, no pattern.
Hit the PLAY button. Hit it again. Again. AGAIN. Try it in a dark room.
If you press a key out of order, the light will blink three times to indicate that you are doing something wrong.
